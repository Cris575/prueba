      <h3 class="love">Electronic hobbyist</h3>
      <p class="love">First circuit that I made was a water level meter using salt-waler, pencil graphite, batteries and an LED salvaged from a torchlight. The love for electronics continued then onwards. Every electronic hobbyist has to come across 555 timer, flipflop or LM714. I spent a lot of time making electronic gadgets like intruder detection with PIC sensor, simple ones like automatic street lamp using LDR sensors. I was also amazed to see the power of development boards like Arduino or Raspberry pi. Later I also did IoT projects with IBM Watson. What I find intriguing is that complex but real problems can be solved with these gadgets and the possibility is infinite. One of my projects can be found here.</p>

    <h3 class="tittle2">Love to build software</h3>
    <p class="part2">I never thought of building software unless I met with Python. I am not a guy who will write some undecipherable software shown in movies and use it through the command line, but yes, sometimes extra GUI becomes overkill. I was introduced with Kivy, a cross-platform Python framework and I loved it. I can remember one of my First wow moments when I successfully built a group chat application using socketio and Kivy and a slight touch of MySQL for the database. I also developed one functional software to compare different map providers which can be found here. Apart from python I worked with Android studio and developed one Car-Key-Manager app, which can be used to book a car with inbuilt chat functionality. It was java until I came across Flutter. I am just loving this framework. Some projects I am working with this framework. Apart from that, I worked with HTML, CSS & Javascript to build a functional app build management website. Apart from software development I also worked with machine learning models to develop use cases for my organization.</p>

    <h3 class="tittle2">Cooking</h3>
    <p class="Cooking2">Being a Bengalee is not complete if you don't know cooking. Well, I do not proclaim myself as one of the top chefs but I can cook some tasty cuisines. I can remember my childhood days in a native village in West Bengal, where we, friends used to play "ranna-bati" where we used to gather vegetables, rice from home and cook them in a clay pot. Wise people will say cooking is an art, well everything is an art, but the point is I really love cooking.</p>

    <h3 class="tittle2">Writing and sketching</h3>
    <p class="Writing2">Also for a Bengalee, poetry is a must. I like to indulge myself in writing when I feel writing so. You can check out my small facebook page. You can also get a glimpse of some of my paintings here.</p>
